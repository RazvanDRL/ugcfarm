## What's the strategy behind finding the "next TikTok".

When TikTok started showing signs of decline, I did something a bit crazy. 

I spent 30 days testing every major TikTok alternative on the market. 

Not just casual posting - I'm talking full immersion, daily content, and $500 in ad spend on each platform.

Why? Because I was tired of guessing where to put my clients' money. 

I needed real answers, not just trending headlines.

Let me tell you, it was an eye-opening experience. 

Some platforms surprised me, others disappointed me, and a few showed potential that nobody's talking about.

But more importantly, I discovered patterns that completely changed how I view social media marketing in 2025.

## Redtag. Why it's more than just the number one app in the store.

First, let's address the elephant in the room: RedTag. 

Yes, it's growing fast. Yes, it's getting a lot of buzz. 

But there's more to the story than download numbers.

What really caught my attention was the engagement patterns...

While testing RedTag, I noticed something fascinating: posts that flopped on TikTok were suddenly getting massive engagement. 

At first, I thought it was just the novelty factor. Then I dug deeper.

The average engagement rate on my test account hit 8.7% - that's nearly triple what we see on TikTok now. 

But here's the interesting part: it wasn't just vanity metrics. 

The click-through rates to external links averaged 4.2%, compared to TikTok's current 1.1%.

## Lemon8's amazing advantage for brand marketing in 2025.

Then there's Lemon8. 

Everyone's calling it the "premium TikTok," but that's missing the point entirely. 

During my testing, I discovered it's actually solving a problem TikTok never could: meaningful engagement with higher-income audiences.

The numbers tell the story. My test account on Lemon8 generated 47% fewer views than TikTok, but drove 312% more website traffic. 

The platform's users aren't just scrolling - they're actually engaging with content.

But not everything was sunshine and rainbows. 

I also tested platforms like Triller and Clash. 

Let's just say there's a reason you don't hear much about them anymore. The user base is there, but the engagement? 

Not so much.
## Quick summary after 30 days of trying to find the best TikTok alternative.

Here's a quick breakdown of what I found after 30 days:

**RedTag** showed the most promise for immediate growth. 

The platform is hungry for content, and early adopters are seeing numbers that remind me of TikTok circa 2020. 

My test account grew from 0 to 12,000 followers in just 30 days, with minimal effort.

**Lemon8** surprised me with its conversion potential. 

While follower growth was slower, the quality of engagement was unprecedented. 

A single product review generated more clicks than a week's worth of TikTok content.

But here's what really matters - the hidden patterns I discovered that nobody's talking about.

**Pattern #1**: The platforms that are succeeding aren't trying to be TikTok clones. 

They're solving TikTok's problems. 

RedTag fixed the creator burnout issue. Lemon8 solved the premium content problem.

**Pattern #2**: The algorithm rewards different behaviors now. 

While TikTok pushes for quantity, these new platforms are all about quality. 

I tested this by posting the same content at different frequencies. 

Consistently, less frequent but higher quality posts outperformed daily content dumps.

**Pattern #3**: The monetization models are evolving. 

These new platforms understand that creator economics matter. 

During my test, I earned more from RedTag's creator fund with 12,000 followers than I did from TikTok with 50,000.

But perhaps the most valuable insight came from watching how users behave on each platform. 

TikTok trained people to expect endless entertainment. These new platforms are training users to expect value.

The implications for brands are huge. 

When I tested product content across platforms, I noticed something fascinating: Users on new platforms spend 42% more time watching product reviews than on TikTok. 

They're not just there to be entertained - they're there to make decisions.

## What should you do as a brand in 2025.

So what's the verdict after 30 days of testing?

If you're looking for pure reach and entertainment value, TikTok is still king. 

But if you're trying to build a brand and drive actual sales? 

The new platforms offer something TikTok lost long ago: intent.

My recommendation? Don't abandon TikTok, but start diversifying now. 

Spend the next 30 days testing RedTag and Lemon8. 

Focus on quality over quantity. Build genuine connections. 

And most importantly, pay attention to what actually drives results, not just views.

Because here's the truth about social media in 2025: The platform that gets you the most views isn't necessarily the one that'll grow your business.
